## About me


I am a university researcher at the University of Jyväskylä, working on heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemistry and surface chemistry. 
I have a Master's degree in Chemical Technology and a PhD in Computational Chemistry from Aalto University as well as Master's degree from Mathematics from the University of Helsinki and a strong background in chemistry, physics and programming. 
I have a lot of experience in interdisciplinary collaboration, communicating my own work to colleagues and helping them to apply my results in their work. 
I also have a long history of teaching to a wide range of audiences, from freshmen to graduate students.
My publication list can be found [here](publications.qmd).

Below I have collected some notes and tutorials. For those who come after.
