    "## How to: Solvation energy for ionic species using DFT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating solvation free energies\n",
    "\n",
    "The dielectric continuum solvent models facilitate the modelling of chemical reactions is condensed phases. The dielectric continuum models the effect of the solvent and can be used to compute the solvation free energy of a species. The solvation free energy $\\Delta G_\\text{solv}$ can be added to the accurate gas-phase free energy values to obtain the corresponding solution-phase free energy: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_\\text{soln} = G_\\text{gas} + \\Delta G_\\text{solv} + RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{RT}{P} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the last term converts the gas-phase standard state to teh solution-phase standard state of 1 M. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few points one needs to address when the continuum solvent models are applied (see https://doi.org/10.1021/jp107136j). The solvation free energy can be computed from the difference between the energies obtained in gas-phase and in the dielectric continuum solvent, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G_\\text{solv} = (E_\\text{soln} + G_\\text{nes}) - E_\\text{gas}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_\\text{soln}$ and $ E_\\text{gas}$ are the electronic energies of the solute with and without the continuum solvent field and $G_\\text{nes}$ refers to the sum of any nonelectrostatic contributions to the solvation free energy, such as cavitation and dispersion-repulsion interactions. \n",
    "The main point here is that the **solvation free energy** is obtained from the difference in **electronic energies**, **not** a difference in free energies computed in solution- and gas-phases. *This is because of the way the continuum models are parametrized and from the fact that the ideal gas models used to compute the free energies only apply in the gas-phase.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to calculate all the components of our thermodynamic cycle we will:\n",
    "1. Optimize all the species in the upper-rung of the thermodynamic cycle in gas-phase\n",
    "2. Compute the total energy and all the free energy terms for these species\n",
    "3. Optimize all the species in the lower-rung of the thermodynamic cycle with the dielectric continuum solvent model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then compute the free energy for the reaction based on the gas-phase free energies,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G_\\text{bind, g} = \\sum_i \\nu_i G_\\text{i} - \\sum_a \\nu_a G_a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ and $a$ correspond to product and reactant species, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solvation energies are then computed using the electronic energies of the species (not including the enthalpy and entropy-terms used in gas-phase calculation). Often, especially for ionic systems, it is preferred to employ a hybrid solvation model, that is to use both explicit and implicit solvent together. This will signicantly improve the accuracy of our solvation energies.\n",
